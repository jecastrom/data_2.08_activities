= Activity 1

* In this activity, we will be using the table `district` from the `bank` database and according to the description for the different columns:

** A4: no. of inhabitants
** A9: no. of cities
** A10: the ratio of urban inhabitants
** A11: average salary
** A12: the unemployment rate

== Rank districts by different variables.

`*_Answer:_*`


** A4: no. of inhabitants

```sql
SELECT
    a2 AS district_name,
    a4 AS no_of_inhabitants,
    rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            a4 DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    district;
```

** A9: no. of cities



```sql
SELECT
    a2 AS district_name,
    a9 AS no_of_cities,
    rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            a9 DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    district;
```

[NOTE]
====
 Notice that the number of cities can repeat or tie. When this occurs 
 the two values receive the same ranking number, and then a gap is left 
 in the ranking numbers. 
 
 The Rank() functions uses a Standard competition ranking strategy. for example 
 ranks in a "Olympic medalling style", if two people  share the gold, there is no 
 silver medalist.footnote:[fn-rank]
 
 If I didn't want the "skipping" of levels, then I should use the Dense_rank() 
 function,  so no olympic medalling style of ranking with Dense_rank().

```sql
 SELECT
    a2 AS district_name,
    a9 AS no_of_cities,
    dense_rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            a9 DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    district;
```
